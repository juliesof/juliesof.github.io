	<h3>How I used to fill my days</h3>
	<div class="dr_seuss"><p> Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, Nothing is going to get better. It's not. <br>~Dr. Seuss, <em>The Lorax</em></div><br><br>
	
	<div class="work_history"><span class="video"><iframe src="http://blip.tv/play/hLZegsO%2BMwI.html?p=1" width="550" height="443" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://a.blip.tv/api.swf#hLZegsO+MwI" style="display:none"></embed><figcaption>I'm famous on YouTube</figcaption>	</span>

	<p>In 2009 I spent a year working for <a href="http://www.accionusa.org" target="_blank" /><strong>ACCION USA</strong></a> through AmeriCorps. I processed loan applications for small business owners, in English and Spanish. I also started their social media program.</p>

	<p>Previously, I was an educator and public speaker about personal finance. I gave talks on creating a livable budget, understanding credit reports, and preventing identity theft.<br>

	The YouTube video, which aired on the Medfield public access station, shows me giving a class to senior citizens on preventing identity theft. They were a sharp and fun bunch of folks!</p></div>

	<div><p>There are many reasons why I want to become a web developer. Of course having a job in a field that's growing every year is a big plus. And having a job that is intellectually stimulating is also very important to me. But one of the most important things to me is being able to use the skills that I have to make the world a better place. Starting with General Assembly and then on through the years I plan on becoming an expert in multiple programming languages. Languages that exist now and those that will come. And I will be able to leverage those skills to make change where the world needs it.</p></div>
